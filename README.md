## General Information
-This project involves building a multiclass classification model using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect melanoma. Melanoma is a deadly   type of skin cancer, and an automated classification system can assist dermatologists in early diagnosis.
- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve? - The goal is to build a CNN-based model that can accurately detect melanoma from skin lesion images. Since melanoma accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths, early detection is crucial for saving lives. This project aims to reduce the manual effort required for diagnosis by developing an AI-based solution.
- What is the dataset that is being used? - The dataset consists of 2,357 images categorized into 9 different skin diseases, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC):



## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 -Initially model is underfitting coz of class imbalance
- Conclusion 2 -The model's performance has improved after addressing class imbalance, as increasing the amount of training data has enhanced its accuracy and effectiveness.
